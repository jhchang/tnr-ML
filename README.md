# tnr-ML
Notebooks where experimentation with individual cat classification is the goal

Cat individual recognition.ipynb
Using dataset in link below but the dataset isn't clean. Dataset has some nested class folders and unsupported file formats like .mov and .heic

There is also a problem with the data pipeline running slowly.

I will upload another test model to try using more state of the art unsupervised learning that is more relevant to the tnr project.
I will also start with a smaller dataset for faster training at first
